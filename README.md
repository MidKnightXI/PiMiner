# PiMiner

PiMiner is an EPITECH Hub project that is supposed to make people discover APIs and
cryptocurrency.

## What is PiMiner ?

PiMiner is a Raspeberry Pi mining Monero and sending infos about the state of the currency
and the system on the phone number of the owner.

## What am I using ?

I'm building the app that is going to send the messages on the state of what is happening on the Pi
with `Typescript` with `finnhub-js` lib and the `Free Mobile API`

## Requirements

To make this script work properly you need these environment variables:
> `FREE_USER`that is your Free Mobile ID
> `FREE_TOKEN` that is the token given on [this site](https://mobile.free.fr/account/)
> `FINNHUB_TOKEN` that is the token given on [this site](https://finnhub.io/dashboard)
